## GIT STARTED

### What is Git ?

Git was invented by Linus Tolvrads in 2005.

Git is a Version Control System. It keeps track of changes that happen across a set of files.
It  does this by creating a git-repository for our project, a hidden directory by the name of **`.git`** where it tracks the changes to the files.

Git takes snapshots (*commits*) of the tracked files, and if and when necessary, we can then travel back in time to any previous version of our files.

#### **Important Terms :**

**Git -** Tracks changes to our files

**Repo -** Tracks the diffs (changes) across the codebase.

**Commit -** Snapshot of the tracked files.

**Head -** represents the most recent commit in the current *branch*.

**Branch -** Alternate timeline for our code.

**Merge -** Combine branches into a single codebase.
